  # Fix RLS Policies for Proper Permission Control

  ## Overview
  This migration replaces overly permissive RLS policies with proper role-based and business-scoped policies.
  
  ## Changes Made
  
  ### 1. Users Table
  - Admins: Full access to all users
  - Business owners: Access users in their business
  - Employees: View own profile only
  - All users can update their own profile
  
  ### 2. Businesses Table
  - Admins: Full access
  - Business owners: Access their own business
  - Employees: View their business only
  
  ### 3. Customers Table
  - Scoped to business_id
  - All authenticated users in a business can manage customers
  
  ### 4. Jobs Table
  - Scoped to business_id
  - Employees can view/update jobs assigned to them
  - Business owners and admins: Full access to business jobs
  
  ### 5. Products Table
  - Public read access for all authenticated users
  - Admins can manage products
  
  ### 6. Notifications Table
  - Users can only access their own notifications
  
  ### 7. Module Permissions Table
  - Users can view their own permissions
  - Admins can manage all permissions
  
  ### 8. Models 3D Table
  - All authenticated users can view and create
  - Scoped by creator for updates/deletes
  
  ### 9. Model Permissions Table
  - Business-scoped access
  - Admins have full control
  
  ### 10. Activity Logs Table
  - Users can view their own logs
  - Admins can view all logs
  
  ### 11. User Sessions Table
  - Users can only access their own sessions
  
  ## Security Notes
  - All policies check authentication first
  - Business-scoped data is properly isolated
  - Users can only access data they own or belong to
  - Admins have elevated privileges across all tables
