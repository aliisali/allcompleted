# 🚀 Render Deployment Guide - BlindsCloud Platform

## 📋 **Quick Deployment Steps**

### **1. Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment with database"

```

### **2. Deploy on Render**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)

jobs (with status tracking)
products (with 3D model support)
notifications (real-time updates)
activity_logs (complete audit trail)
```

### **API Endpoints**
```
POST /api/auth/login          - User authentication
GET  /api/users               - User management

GET  /api/customers           - Customer data
POST /api/uploads/single      - File uploads
```

### **Security Features**
- JWT authentication with database sessions
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Row-level security policies
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and CORS protection

## 🎮 **Demo Accounts**

After deployment, use these accounts to test:

| Role | Email | Password | Access Level |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Admin** | `admin@blindscloud.co.uk` | `password` | Full platform control |
| **Business** | `business@blindscloud.co.uk` | `password` | Business management |
| **Employee** | `employee@blindscloud.co.uk` | `password` | Field operations |

- Comprehensive reporting dashboard
- Module-based access control

---

## 🔍 **Post-Deployment Testing**

### **1. Verify Database Connection**
- Check backend health: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/health`
- Should return: `{"status": "OK", "database": "Connected"}`

### **2. Test Authentication**
- Login with demo accounts
- Verify user sessions persist
- Check role-based access control

### **3. Test Core Features**
- Create new users (admin only)
- Add customers and jobs
- Upload files and images
- Test AR camera functionality

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

**Database Connection Fails:**
- Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Run migration: Backend service → Shell → `npm run migrate`

**CORS Errors:**
- Verify FRONTEND_URL is set correctly in backend
- Check that frontend VITE_API_URL points to backend

**File Uploads Fail:**
- Ensure UPLOAD_DIR exists (created automatically)
- Check MAX_FILE_SIZE environment variable
